# EvilEmail: because why not?

EvilEmail is a small thing I use for individual randomized email addresses unique to specific services.

## How do I use it?

I don't have any instructions yet, this is more or less a code dump, if I get requests I will probably make some instructions.

Please tell me if you would like for me to make instructions via [a44e65fe-312a-486d-b5da-a51a2a62f6a6@email.cynthia.re](mailto:a44e65fe-312a-486d-b5da-a51a2a62f6a6@email.cynthia.re) or Twitter: [@bitcynth](https://twitter.com/bitcynth).

## Credits

This was inspired by a very similar thing a friend has setup.

I also based a lot of the app script ideas on my friend Ben's [GeoIP Tagger](https://github.com/benjojo/Gmail_GeoIPTagger).
